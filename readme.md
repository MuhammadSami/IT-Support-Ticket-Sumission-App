# IT Complaint Support app

A web app to lodge complaints.
- Sessions were not implemented but can be done very easily.
- Lets user add comments and there is a page for users to look up their complaints using their email
- Once the sessions are implmented these pages can be restricted to users and employees.
- Will soon be finishing up the app to implment sessions and add Categories for employees to be assigned to these complaints.
